<h2> An Uncolicited Ramble</h2>
        

<p>
<!-- Just thoughts about what I see, not meant to be well articulated or formal-->
it truly baffles me how many people buy into the obviously disingenous speeches and policies from 
<a class="two" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dense bigots</a>.
</p> 

<a class="Frank" href="Page2.html"><img src="frank-heffley-2.jpg" alt="Schizo-post"></a>  

<p>

They say the reason why everyone's lives have gone to shit is because of  
<a class="three" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eytlX2OTKPs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
"dirty migrants th steal jobs, take homes tanking the housing market and EATING THEIR PETS"</a>...
I'M NOT JOKING THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED <a class="four">FUCKING</a> STATES SAID THIS!!!! The mere fact that people can knowingly vote for such
an 
<a class="five" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imbecile</a> 
is truly mistifying. 
The right alienate and villanise minorities because they continiously need scapegoats
and specific group of people to blame for their lives getting <a class="six">shittier </a> and <a class="seven"></a> shittier and <a class="eight"></a>shittier. It is no suprise that the political parties that 
receive a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-budget-taxes-reeves-starmer-labour-badenoch-farage-12593360?postid=10642720#liveblog-body">metric fuck ton of money</a>
from multi-millionaires and billionaires are the ones that are directed towards 12IQ racsist who label themselves
'nationalists'.

Prioritising the <a href="Page3.html">divide</a> of working class people so that the 1% can control continue hoarding and hosting their poumpous 
<a class="six" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mountbatten-Windsor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pedo</a> parties

</p>    

<p>
    
 A distraction tactic that the 
    <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-and-racism-what-do-the-data-say/" target="_blank">
        populist right
    </a> 
    has relied on for years.
</p>

<p>
    This 
    <a href="https://socialistworker.co.uk/anti-racism/the-politics-of-reform-uk-despair-wrapped-in-racism/" target="_blank">
     strategy
    </a> 
    somehow keeps working-class communities
    divided and obliviously vulnerable to manipulation. Meanwhile, 
    the asshats at the forefront of these narratives — such as those in 
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/04/reform-uk-deputy-richard-tice-farage-antisemitism-allegations-made-up-twaddle" target="_blank">
        Reform UK
    </a> 
    or the broader 
    <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/articles/the-maga-ideology-and-the-trump-regime/" target="_blank">
        MAGA movement
    </a> 
    — continue to exploit social tensions through race while deflecting attention from the actual 
    centers of power.
</p>

<p>
The extremely evident problem is that people <a href="Page3.html" class="eight">divide</a> themselves by race and not financial classes, which everyone should 
see ffs.
</p>

<p>
Like how has it actually gotten to the point where the US can literally commit fucking WAR CRIMES, and essentially 
have a reincarnation of the <a class="fourteen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo"> Gestapo</a> just running around abducting people based on race, extremely 
<a class="ten" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany">Nazi-like</a> 
if you ask me. But of course it's obvious
<a class="eleven"  href="https://medium.com/@richard.brody/eerie-horrific-similarities-between-ice-gestapo-f094e7fffa1e">
    cruelty</a> is just excused as 'PRoTECtIng tHE  cOunTrY'

</p>

<p>
It's genuinely stupifying the <a class="nine"  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dm_5qWWDV8&list=RD3dm_5qWWDV8&start_radio=1"> hysteria</a>
that has been centered around this whilst the super-rich get even richer.
Like whilst Elon Musk panders to white nationalists and tells them  to <a class="twelve" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSETb5QRLW0"> "Fight or Die"</a> there's rumours of him becoming 
a <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/29/elon-musk-pay-package-details-tesla-stock-outlook/"> TRILLIONAIRE</a>. Not likely to actually happen but the fact there's even speculation around it insanity.


I know I've just repeated the same thing over and over and over and over again but shit man it's so fucking insane.
It's not even like any of what i've said has any real substance of it's own. Literally just some stupid <a class="twelve"> shitheads </a>
in the world. (Sorry this might've come off as a bit violent). In a 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G23iLGhh9lo&list=RDG23iLGhh9lo&start_radio=1">
Nutshell</a>, i despise how hateful people can be.
