My project is a self-expression piece that is centered around texts, GIFs and hyperlinks to articles or videos
related to my little rant. The project functions as a piece that hopefull educates people on the current divided state of the US and UK, and who I believe the catalysts for this are. I was heavily influenced by 'Douglas Davis (1994), The World’s First Collaborative Sentence'. This is largely down to how much I enjoyed the informal and sometimes incoherent self-expression. Another inspiration came through 'Olia Lialina (1996), My Boyfriend Came Back from the War'. I found the colour scheme and grittiness of the images appealing due to how unique and morbid it felt. I only wish I was able to intigrate more of this into my project, only managing to try and recreate the black and white aesthetics. Further inspirations was sourced by 'Mendi Obadike (2001), Keeping Up Appearances'. I liked the hidden text that would appear when interacting with it due to the fact that it could act as some sort of censor, for swear-words or sensitive topics.

If I had the opportunity to extend this project, I'd spend more time honing my ability to make higher quality GIF animations, and perhaps work on my ability to decorate with style.css, as I only used very simple techniques such as borders, padding and background colours. In addition to this, I would expand the number of images or html pages that my project could explore like with 'My Boyfriend came back from the war'.  I could also source more inspiration from 'Mendi Obadike (2001), Keeping Up Appearances' by making my textual 'censors' more purposeful and meaningful with time, perhaps scattered less randomly.
